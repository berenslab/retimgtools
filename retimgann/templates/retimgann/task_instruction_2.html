<h1>Drusen annotation for OCT</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
    Your task is to annotate drusen annotation for OCT. By moving the mouse over the image, you get a magnified cutout of the image in the small window below. All images are from patients with DR of grade 0 ("no DR"), grade 1 ("mild DR") and grade 2 ("moderate DR"). For best contrast, you may need to adjust the brightness of your monitor to maximal.
</p>
<p>
    To mark a lesion, simply click on the image.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure you work carefully and annotate all lesions that are present. When you are done with an image, click "submit". The annotations will be saved.
</p>
<p>
    If you need to interrupt a session, we will load the images and corresponding annotations that you have already submitted.
</p>


<h2>Information about the study</h2>

<p>
    Your annotations will be saved on a secure server in the EU and will be used to assess the quality of the disease prediction of an AI algorithm. Also, mouse movements will be tracked as long as the cursor is above the image. If you have additional questions, do not hesitate to ask. No personal information will be disclosed at any time. Please check "consent" below if you agree to these terms.
