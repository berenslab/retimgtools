<h1>Task 1 Instruction</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        For each question in this task, you are shown a set of <b>three</b> fundus images or OCT scans labelled as <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have to <b>determine which image is fake</b> i.e. generated by our deep learning model and select the label corresponding to the generated image.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will have a time limit of <b>5</b> s for each question. Images will be hidden after the completion of the time limit.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can zoom in to observe the image regions more closely to make your decision.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Task 2 Condition 1 Instruction</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        For each question in this task, you are shown a <b>single</b> fundus image or an OCT scan.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a fundus image you have to first make a diagnosis whether the shown image has referable Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) i.e. moderate, severe, or proliferative DR. Following this you will be asked to rate the confidence of your decision on a scale of 1 to 10.
    </li>
    <li>
        For an OCT scan, you have to choose whether the scan is healthy or affected by either Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), drusen, or Diabetic Macular Edema.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only one of the options can be selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can zoom in to observe the image regions more closely to make your decision.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no time limit for this task, the time taken to make the decision is recorded.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Task 2 Condition 2 Instruction</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        For each question in this task, you are shown a set of 3 fundus images or OCT scans.
    </li>
    <li>
        The image in the center is the original image. The image on the left is a healthier version of the original image generated by our deep learning model. The image on the right is a more diseased version of the original image also generated by the model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on these images, you have to make a diagnosis whether the original image has referable Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) i.e. moderate, severe, or proliferative DR. Following this you will be asked to rate the confidence of your decision on a scale of 1 to 10.
    </li>
    <li>
        For an OCT scan, you have to choose whether the original scan is healthy or affected by either Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), drusen, or Diabetic Macular Edema.
